 <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">RAG rating examples</h1>

        <p>To help you choose a rating, we've provided some examples of what you might include when RAG (red, amber, green) rating your projects.</p>

        <p>The examples do not cover every scenario and are simply to help you decide how to rate a project. </p>

    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Spend risk</h1>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Green</h2>

        <p>No rising costs, no slippage, less than 30% expenditure profiled in final year, no use of financial flexibility.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Amber/Green</h2>

        <p>Project progressing but with minor issues, issues are within control and there is a mitigation plan in place, there is no additional support required.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Amber</h2>

        <p>Cost increases of 10% to 20% which are manageable, a funding gap exists but a source has been identified (although not secured), there is slippage of 20% to 30% between financial years, 40% to 50% of expenditure is profiled in the final year, the use of flexibility is required but below the threshold.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Amber/Red</h2>

        <p>No rising costs, no slippage, less than 30% expenditure profiled in final year, no use of financial flexibility.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Red</h2>
